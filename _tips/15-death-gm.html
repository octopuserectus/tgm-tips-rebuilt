  <p>Starting from Lv.500 the speed in death mode doesn't increase at all.<br>
     Any increase in speed is merely an illusion.</p>

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Lock delay only resets when a piece drops, giving you extra thinking time.<br>
         The O in this case does not reset the lock delay, thus the I could surprise you.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         In this case, where you are using DAS on all the blocks, you'll be thrown off rhythm when a block doesn't have a lock delay reset or when you clear lines.<br>
         You should be careful not to start another DAS when the current block has not fixed yet, or too late for that matter.

      <h3 class="section-heading" style="color: #ffff00;">● Shape of Waiting</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.6;">
          When you get used to it to some extent, it may seem like you decide where to place blocks in an instant, but there are still cases where it's relatively easy to find a placement and cases where it's not.<br>
          If you continue in a situation where you can find a place without thinking too much, your brain gets used to "not thinking too much."<br>
          So, what happens when you encounter a difficult shape where a suitable placement isn't easily found, or conversely, a situation where several reasonable placements are possible?<br>
          <br>
          When your personal best reaches the Lv 700s or 800s, sometimes you're stacking beautifully with plenty of room, feeling like you won't die at all, and then suddenly, *gogogo* [sound of impending doom], instant death.<br>
          If the situation becomes fast and severe, the brain tries to adapt by thinking faster, but conversely, if it becomes slow and lenient, the brain gets used to that and stops thinking as much.<br>
          Be aware that when you're stacking cleanly, you're right next to the danger of *gogogo*-ing. It's important not to let your brain get lazy; don't stop thinking just because you've found one way to place a piece, but rather come up with several candidates.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading" style="color: #ffff00;">● Distance to NEXT</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 0.9em; line-height: 1.6;">
          Even if you say, "Judge the NEXT piece by color in the corner of your vision," if the distance is far (meaning the stack is low), you should need to use slightly more brainpower to grasp it.<br>
          Usually, you don't think about such things. But what about when you lower the stack significantly with consecutive line clears?<br>
          You shift from a situation where you were clearly seeing both the stack and the NEXT piece simultaneously to one where you must grasp the NEXT piece in the corner of your vision.<br>
          Your actual judgment speed slightly decreases. Nevertheless, the player themselves isn't conscious of this, which is why they feel like they've gotten faster.<br>
          <br>
          Be aware that <span class="highlight">"making the stack low and flat," which tends to be thought of as safe because death is far away, is actually dangerous when the drop speed is fast.</span><br>
          Conversely, even if you *gogogo* and the stack gets high, as long as the top two rows are empty, you won't die. If you think that the distance to the NEXT piece shrinks and becomes easier to see, you should be able to feel more composure.
      </p>
