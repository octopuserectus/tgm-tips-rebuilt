  <p>From Lv 500 onwards, compared to the 400 range, ARE and line clear times shorten slightly. That said, if you can stack solidly in the 400 range, it's not an unmanageable speed.<br>
     The problem is the long haul of 5 sections and having to battle various illusions that make you feel it's faster even though the speed hasn't changed.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Lock Delay Reset Trap</h3>

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Lock delay reset doesn't only happen when intentionally trying to gain time.<br>
         In situations where charge delays inevitably occur frequently, the "time spent stationary in the center + lock delay after falling" becomes the "apparent lock time".

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         In particular, situations where "inputting the lever after appearance causes an immediate drop (= lock delay reset)" occur frequently.<br>
         In such "droppable situations", starting the DAS charge at any timing before locking will always make it in time.<br>
         Whether it's "droppable" depends on the block type and whether it rotates, so being able to grasp this instantly during actual play (while minimizing interference with stacking thoughts) requires considerable practice.<br>
         Usually, one often plays without knowing whether it's "droppable", and doesn't particularly pay attention to charge delays, likely relying on the rhythm of actual block appearances.<br>
         However, after a period of such slower situations, what happens when suddenly faced with a "non-droppable situation"? Wouldn't it suddenly feel faster?

  <h3 class="section-heading">Shape of Waiting</h3>
  <p>
      When you get used to it to some extent, it may seem like you decide where to place blocks in an instant, but there are still cases where it's relatively easy to find a placement and cases where it's not.<br>
      If you continue in a situation where you can find a place without thinking too much, your brain gets used to "not thinking too much."<br>
      So, what happens when you encounter a difficult shape where a suitable placement isn't easily found, or conversely, a situation where several reasonable placements are possible?<br><br>
      When your personal best reaches the Lv 700s or 800s, sometimes you're stacking beautifully with plenty of room, feeling like you won't die at all, and then suddenly, *gogogo*, instant death.<br>
      If the situation becomes fast and severe, the brain tries to adapt by thinking faster, but conversely, if it becomes slow and lenient, the brain gets used to that and stops thinking as much.<br>
      Be aware that when you're stacking cleanly, you're right next to the danger of *gogogo*-ing. It's important not to let your brain get lazy; don't stop thinking just because you've found one way to place a piece, but rather come up with several candidates.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Distance to NEXT</h3>
  <p>
      Even if you say, "Judge the NEXT piece by color in the corner of your vision," if the distance is far (meaning the stack is low), you should need to use slightly more brainpower to grasp it.<br>
      Usually, you don't think about such things. But what about when you lower the stack significantly with consecutive line clears?<br>
      You shift from a situation where you were clearly seeing both the stack and the NEXT piece simultaneously to one where you must grasp the NEXT piece in the corner of your vision.<br>
      Your actual judgment speed slightly decreases. Nevertheless, the player themselves isn't conscious of this, which is why they feel like they've gotten faster.<br><br>
      Be aware that <span class="highlight">"making the stack low and flat," which tends to be thought of as safe because death is far away, is actually dangerous when the drop speed is fast.</span><br>
      Conversely, even if you *gogogo* and the stack gets high, as long as the top two rows are empty, you won't die. If you think that the distance to the NEXT piece shrinks and becomes easier to see, you should be able to feel more composure.
