  <p>
    TGM Follows the SEGA rotation system. All of the blocks except I always have a block in the lowest row, and in this way, appear to roll on the ground.<br>
    This might seem unnatural at first, but I think it is easier to use in high speed situations.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">The Well</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/basics/kiso01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="TGM Playfield Diagram" width="119" height="239">
    <div class="text">
      The well is a <span class="highlight">20 rows by 10 columns</span> field.<br>
      However, as shown to the left, the blocks can go over the uppermost row.<br>
      The stacked blocks as a whole are called the stack.<br>
      The game is over when blocks are forced to overlap.<br>
      Above the well you can see the next block to come.
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Levels</h3>
  <p>
    Progress in the game is represented by levels.<br>
    The game starts at level 0 and end at level 999.<br>
    For each block to appear the level <span class="highlight">will raise by 1</span>. Every time you clear lines the level will go up by the amount of lines cleared.<br><br>
    Every level divisible by 100 is the start of a new <span class="highlight">section.</span><br>
    To rise from x99 to x00 or from 998 to 999 you will need to clear a line.<br><br>
    Examples:<br>
    - Clearing a line at Lv.99 will raise it to 100, the next block to enter the well will raise it to 101.<br>
    - Clearing 4 lines at Lv.95 will raise it to 99, when the next block enters the well it <b>still</b> be at Lv.99
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">20G</h3>
  <p>
    A frame is calculated 60 times every second.<br>
    The amount of rows a block descends every frame is called a <span class="highlight">G</span>.<br>
    TGM Has a new mode called <b>20G</b> in which blocks appear at the bottom of the well.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">ARE/Lock delay</h3>
  <p>
    When blocks fall on the stack there is a brief period before they lock.<br>
    This allows you to move blocks in 20G mode.<br>
    This period is called the Lock Delay and is set at about 0.5 seconds.<br><br>
    There is also a brief pause after a block locks and before the next one appears, this is called the ARE.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Soft drop/Manual Lock</h3>
  <p>
    You can make a block fall faster by holding the control stick down. It will fall at 1G unless the current speed is higher than 1G, then it will not fall faster.<br>
    If you pull the control stick down while a block is on the ground it will lock despite any lock delays.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">IRS</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
     <div class="example-images">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/basics/kiso02.PNG' | relative_url }}" alt="S piece spawning normally causing game over" width="119" height="239">
        <span class="arrow">→</span> 
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/basics/kiso03.PNG' | relative_url }}" alt="S piece spawning rotated via IRS, avoiding game over" width="119" height="239">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/images/basics/kiso07.PNG' | relative_url }}" alt="Close up of IRS'd S piece" width="119" height="239">
     </div>
     <div class="text example-explanation">
        IRS Can be used to prevent a game over.<br>
        Normal appearance of the S block would have caused a game over by intersecting the Z block. IRS prevents this.<br>
        <span class="highlight">IRS will be blocked when it would cause a game over.</span>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Wall kicks</h3>

       <img src="{{ '/assets/images/basics/02.png' | relative_url }}" alt="T piece rotated, kicking off wall" width="119" height="239">
     </div>
     <div class="text example-explanation">
       According to the table above this rotation should be impossible.<br>
       But, because of an empty space to the right the T will kick the wall.<br>
       Wall kicks, along with IRS make TGM a comfortable series to play.<br>
