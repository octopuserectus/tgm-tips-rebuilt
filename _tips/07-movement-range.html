         A basic example of using IRS to land with the 2-wide side down to cross a 1-cell gap.<br>
         It might be good to get used to spawning J and L pieces in this orientation.

         <b>"J-piece 3 Rotations" (青の３回転 - ao no 3 kaiten):</b><br>
         Prevent falling into the gap by orienting the wide side downwards.<br>
         In most cases, IRS is needed for the first rotation.<br>
         The pattern in the right diagram is slightly more difficult and requires performing the first two rotations quickly.<br>
         Learning the feel of intentionally delaying the DAS charge (溜め遅れる - tame okureru) is useful.

         Examples of the operation "horizontal, horizontal charge, rotate". The key is quickly inputting sideways twice and holding the second input.<br>
         Especially, it's easier if the rotation causes a drop (lock delay reset), but severe if not. It's too late if you wait to visually confirm the block's appearance, so judging the block appearance timing is necessary.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         So, what can be done when the shape is like this?<br>
         Comparing the 20G rule "if there's a step, it always falls to the lowest point" and the I-piece's rotation rule, it seems like it would get caught on the 3rd column.<br>
         However, in this case, if you<br><br>
         "DAS charge left with the piece flat all the way to the edge, then rotate"<br><br>
         you can place it in the 1st column.<br>
         The principle is explained below.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Synchronous Actions (シンクロ - Synchro)</h3>
  <p>
    Performing multiple operations within a single frame.<br>
    As mentioned in <a href="{{ '/tips/01-basics.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 1</a>, a frame is the smallest unit of screen drawing, but within each frame, it's known that judgments are performed in the order:<br>
    <span class="highlight">Rotation → Horizontal Movement → Drop</span><br><br>
    If both rotation and horizontal movement are performed in one frame, horizontal movement becomes possible even in mid-air during 20G.<br>
    Generally, "Synchro" refers to advanced techniques like those introduced in <a href="{{ '/tips/12-advanced-techniques.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 12</a>, but here it's broadly considered as a "phenomenon" for explanation.

      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         A slightly difficult pattern: move with right charge, then re-charge left.<br>
         Generally, this might be what's referred to as a reverse somersault (逆上がり - saka-agari).<br>
         Be careful, as insufficient charge will cause it to slide down, and rotating too late will cause it to lock as is.<br><br>
         By the way, if you can input horizontal and rotation simultaneously, charging isn't necessary. It's good to try challenging it on terrain where sliding down doesn't matter.
