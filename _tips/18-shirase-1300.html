  <h3 class="section-heading">Lv.500 wall</h3>
  <p>
    Starting speeds are equal to TAP Death mode Lv.200.<br>
    Lv.300 is Death mode Lv.500 speed.<br>
    The Lv.500 torikan is 02:28:00.<br><br>
    Think of the early stages as a training ground for watching the 3 NEXT blocks, aiming for 30 seconds per section.<br>
    Instead of trying to lock each block as fast as possible, focusing on being able to soft drop with a consistent rhythm might actually be faster in the end.<br><br>
    Regarding soft dropping after Lv.300, as shown in the S10 movie (tgm3shirase.mpg) released by <a href="http://www.arika.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arika</a>, it's possible to pass Lv.500 without doing it, but it's probably better to be able to do it considering later stages. However, as mentioned in the previous chapter, be careful not to push the speed too much and suddenly collapse. If you're not used to it, don't continue for too long; break it down into several blocks at a time, checking if the terrain is okay and if you're watching the 3 NEXT blocks.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Lv.500-1000</h3>
  <p>
    Above Lv.500 the lock delay will decrease.<br>
    Lines of garbage will be added, but no information is known on the system. (Editor's note: more information can be found <a href="http://harddrop.com/wiki/index.php?title=TGM3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.)<br><br>
    At first, even just one row of garbage might seem incredibly high, but don't give in to the pressure. Excessive fear alone reduces your thinking ability. If you get crushed by the rising garbage, just think of it as an unavoidable accident.<br>
    If you build the shape waiting for an I-piece on the right edge, the Tetris hole only deepens by one row. Even after Lv.700 when the garbage rises faster, only enough comes up that can be cleared with a single Tetris. Think of <span class="highlight">"aiming for a Tetris" not as something you do because you have room, but because stacking that way is safer</span>.
    If the terrain gets low, or if a block comes that's a bit difficult to place, don't hesitate to cover the right-edge hole. While you're uncovering that lid, the Tetris hole will naturally rise on its own. Once you start seeing the rising garbage as an "aid" rather than an "obstacle," you're in good shape.<br><br>
    Because the lock delay is short, the actual lock time changes drastically due to step resets, and there's a high risk of suddenly "gogogo-ing" (dying quickly) even when you seem to be stacking with some room. By reusing horizontal charge (DAS), learn the "fastest rhythm (without soft drop)". At first, you might keep the rhythm in your head based on the block appearance sound or visually, but eventually, if you can <span class="highlight">learn the speed through the "movement of your hands"</span> - knowing what rhythm to operate with - your mind can focus on thinking about the terrain.<br>
    Regarding stacking, doing the same thing repeatedly tends to slow down thinking. After reusing horizontal charge for a while, try adjusting the terrain with step resets while checking the overall field, stack reasonably high then dig down low, or think "I skimmed last time, maybe I'll try stacking without clearing lines this time," etc. It's good to <span class="highlight">add variety to your stacking</span>.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Lv.1000 and up</h3>
  <p>
    No more rising garbage.<br>
    Blocks will be white <b>[ ]</b> shapes.<br>
    Above Lv.1100 the lock delay will decrease.<br>
    Above Lv.1200 the lock delay will decrease.<br><br>
    Around Lv.1000, there's no change in lock delay etc., but because it becomes harder to see and operations tend to lag, you might feel it has slowed down.<br>
    First, you need to get used to the poor visibility. While it's possible to just "roughly understand" or "memorize" the terrain, for the NEXT queue, it's meaningless in most cases if you can't identify which type of block it is. Since the height and unevenness of the terrain constantly change, there isn't a fixed point to look at; I think you intuitively learn the "distribution of awareness" needed to grasp both the NEXT queue and the terrain by repeatedly shifting your gaze up and down.<br><br>
    At Lv.1100, the speed increases considerably, so you might frequently clear lines trying to keep the terrain as low as possible, but this means <span class="highlight">the "terrain changes" become more drastic</span>. Grasping the terrain becomes difficult, and if your gaze gradually drifts away from the 3 NEXT blocks, it directly leads to death. As mentioned earlier, you want to have "variety in your stacking".<br>
    Once you're somewhat used to it, to prepare for the Lv.1200 range, try to frequently reuse horizontal charge to create the "fastest speed" possible. Entering the same speed feels different depending on whether the change was abrupt or gradual; the latter should be easier to handle.<br><br>
    Even in the Lv.1200 range, "learning the speed with hand movements" as mentioned before is advantageous, but just playing normally makes it difficult to acquire this skill through Lv.1200 experience alone, as the speed itself is unfamiliar. Therefore, I think it's good to try soft dropping after Lv.500. This allows you to create a rhythm comparable to (or even faster than) the Lv.1200 range. Since the ARE doesn't change after Lv.300, if you can soft drop with somewhat tight timing, you should be able to do it with the same rhythm after Lv.500. The purpose of soft dropping at this point is purely to "get the rhythm into your hands," not for time attack, so don't force connections; if the terrain becomes even slightly dangerous, stop and focus on fixing it.<br>
    Once you understand the rhythm and can clearly see the 3 NEXT blocks, even at Lv.1200, the fear of the "speed" itself disappears, and it starts to feel merely like a stage where pieces "stick easily." As the time you feel this way gradually increases, clearing is just around the corner.
