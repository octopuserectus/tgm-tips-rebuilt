  <h3 class="section-heading">The Lv 500 Wall</h3>
  <p>
    ・Starts at a speed comparable to TAP Death mode Lv 200 range.<br>
    ・Lv 300 and 400 ranges are comparable to Death mode Lv 500 speed.<br>
    ・Time limit to pass Lv 500 is within 2 minutes 28 seconds.<br><br><br>
    Think of the early stages as training for looking at 3 NEXT pieces, and aim for 30 seconds per section.<br>
    Instead of trying to lock each individual block at maximum speed, focusing on maintaining a constant soft drop rhythm might actually result in faster times.<br><br>
    Regarding soft drop from Lv 300 onwards, as shown in the <a href="{{ '/assets/images/18vid/tgm3shirase.mpg' | relative_url }}">S10 video</a>  released by <a href="https://www.arika.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arika</a>, passing Lv 500 is possible without it, but considering the later stages, I think being able to do it is better. However, as mentioned in the previous chapter, be careful not to suddenly collapse by pushing the speed too much. Until you're used to it, don't continue for too long; do it in small bursts of a few blocks, checking if the stack shape is okay and if you're seeing all three NEXT pieces.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Lv 500 ~ Lv 1000</h3>
  <p>
    ・At Lv 500, lock delay and line clear time shorten.<br>
    ・At Lv 600, lock delay shortens.<br>
    ・The terrain of the first row gets copied and pushes upwards. Details are unknown, but generally, it rises 2 rows each in the 500s and 600s, 4 rows each in the 700s and 800s, and 5-6 rows in the 900s.<br><br><br>
    At first, even a 1-row rise might feel incredibly high, but don't succumb to the pressure. Excessive fear itself reduces thinking capacity. If you get crushed by the rising garbage, think of it as a happening and unavoidable. That's probably fine.<br>
    If you create an I-piece setup on the right edge, the Tetris hole just gets 1 row deeper. Even after 700 when the rising pace quickens, only about 4 rows' worth comes up, which disappears with a single Tetris clear. Think of it this way: <span class="highlight"><strong>"Aiming for Tetrises" isn't done because you have room, but because stacking that way is safer</strong></span>. If the stack gets low, or if a block comes that's slightly awkward to place, don't hesitate to cover and block the hole on the right edge. While recovering that lid, the Tetris hole will rise on its own. Once you can think of the rising garbage not as an "obstacle" but as an "assist", you've got it.<br><br>
    Because the lock delay is short, the change in actual lock time due to step resets is drastic, and the risk of suddenly *gogogo*-ing when you thought you were stacking with some leeway is high. Learn the "fastest rhythm (without soft drop)" by reusing DAS charge. Initially, you might keep rhythm by listening to the block appearance sound or visually tracking, but eventually, if you can <span class="highlight"><strong>learn the speed through the "hand movements"</strong></span> needed for a certain rhythm, your mind can concentrate on thinking about the stack shape.<br>
    Regarding stacking methods, thinking tends to become sluggish if you only do the same things. After reusing DAS charge for a while, adjust the stack shape with step drops while checking the overall stack; stack somewhat high then dig down low; or think "I skimmed last time, so maybe I'll stack up without clearing lines this time" – I think it's good to <span class="highlight"><strong>add variety to your stacking</strong></span>.<br>
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Lv 1000 Onwards</h3>
  <p>
    ・The rising garbage stops.<br>
    ・Blocks composed of white <B>[ ]</B> start falling.<br>
    ・At Lv 1100, lock delay shortens.<br>
    ・At Lv 1200, lock delay shortens.<br><br><br>
    There's no change in lock delay etc. around Lv 1000, but because it becomes harder to see, operations tend to lag, which might make it feel slower.<br>
    First, you must get used to the poor visibility. While the stack shape can sometimes be "roughly known is enough" or "memorized", for NEXT, it's meaningless unless you can identify which type of block it is in most cases. Since the height and bumps of the stack constantly change, there isn't a fixed point to look at; I think it's about intuitively learning the "distribution of awareness" needed to grasp both NEXT and the stack by repeatedly shifting your gaze up and down.<br><br>
    At Lv 1100, the speed also increases considerably, so you might frequently clear lines thinking "keep the stack low, keep it low", but that means <span class="highlight"><strong>"stack changes" become drastic</strong></span>. Grasping the stack shape becomes difficult, and if your gaze gradually drifts away from the 3 NEXT pieces, it directly leads to death. As mentioned above, aim for "stacking with variety".<br>
    Once you're somewhat used to it, to prepare for the Lv 1200 range, try creating the "fastest speed" possible by frequently reusing DAS charge. Even when entering the same speed, the ease of adaptation should differ depending on whether the change is sudden or more gradual.<br><br>
    Even in the Lv 1200 range, "learning the speed with hand movements" mentioned before is advantageous, but normally, that speed itself is inexperienced, so learning it solely through Lv 1200 range experience is difficult. Therefore, I think it's good to challenge soft drop after Lv 500. This allows creating a rhythm equivalent to (or faster than) the Lv 1200 range. Since ARE doesn't change after Lv 300, if you can soft drop at a somewhat trimmed timing, you should be able to do it with the same rhythm after 500 as well. The purpose of soft drop at this point is purely to "imprint the rhythm onto your hands", not time attack, so don't force connections; if the stack shape becomes even slightly dangerous, interrupt and focus on stabilizing.<br>
    Once you understand the rhythm and can clearly see 3 NEXT pieces, even the 1200 range loses its fear factor regarding "speed" itself, and you start to feel it's merely a stage where pieces "stick easily". As the time you feel this way gradually lengthens, clearing is just around the corner.<br>
