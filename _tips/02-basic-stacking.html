      <div class="text example-explanation">
         If you make many deep vertical holes, you might top out trying to fill them...<br>
         To avoid this, let's fill troublesome holes before they become a problem.<br><br>
         Holes 2 blocks deep can be filled by 3 types of blocks (usually I, L, J). Since that's 3 out of 7 blocks, you can expect them about half the time, so it's not too scary. However, if multiple such holes form, it becomes dangerous, so aim to fill them early.<br>
         If one wall of the hole is 3 blocks high, only 2 types of blocks can fit. Prioritize filling these.<br>
         If the depth becomes 3 or more, you're waiting only for the I-piece.<br><br>
         Keep these things in mind first.

        So, is it better if it's flat? If there's too little unevenness, placing the Z-piece or S-piece smoothly becomes difficult.<br><br>
        If the bumps are too fine (frequent), placing pieces like the O-piece becomes troublesome.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         It's more common to run into trouble from too much unevenness than from the stack being too flat, so basically aim for a smooth shape as you stack. Placing blocks vertically tends to create steps.<br>
         If you find yourself thinking, "I keep making deep vertical holes and it's causing problems," try practicing <span class="highlight">using blocks while keeping them as flat as possible</span>.<br>
         In particular, placing the <span class="highlight">S-piece and Z-piece flat</span> is important.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Learning NEXT by Color and Patternizing Stacking</h3>
  <p> 
    Once you get used to it a bit, you start thinking about where to place the next block while looking at "NEXT". At that time, it's good to get into the habit of <span class="highlight">judging NEXT by color</span>.<br>
    That way, you can grasp NEXT just by having it in the corner of your vision. In TGM, where the drop speed gets faster and faster, there's no time to think about placement after the block appears in the well.<br>
    ・Judge where to place the block by comparing the stack and NEXT the moment NEXT appears.<br>
    　↓<br>
    ・Also grasp the control method needed to place it there beforehand.<br>
    　↓<br>
    ・When that block appears, instantly operate and place it quickly.<br>
    You won't keep up if you can't do this.

      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         The Z-piece can stack with Z, and the S-piece with S. This is very commonly used when filling 2-column wide gaps.<br>
         The moment you place a Z-piece, try to recognize "now I need a Z-piece" without even looking at the shape.<br><br>
         The T-piece is a useful block that can fit into both Z-piece and S-piece needs.<br>
         And when placed, it swaps the need between Z and S.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         The J-piece can be used with J, and the L-piece with L.<br>
         In this case, the I-piece swaps the need between them.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Reading the Piece Flow (Tsumo)</h3>
  <p> 
    In the TGM series, the piece sequence (ツモ - tsumo) is adjusted to come out balanced.<br>
    It's unlikely for the same block to appear multiple times consecutively, or for a specific block to not appear for a long time.<br>
    Therefore, even if it's not yet visible in NEXT, predicting something like "I haven't seen a Yellow (O-piece) recently, so one should be coming soon" allows you to think about placement advantageously.

         "A 3-column wide hole with a convex bottom" is a shape that appears quite often.<br>
         When a T-piece comes here, the question is whether to create a need for a J-piece or an L-piece.<br>
         (It's said that after a J-piece appears, an L-piece is three times more likely to appear than another J-piece.)
      </div>

  <div class="info-section">

         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/2pics/15.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Reading block flow example 2 start" width="119" height="239">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/2pics/17.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Reading block flow example 2 mid" width="119" height="239">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/2pics/18.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Reading block flow example 2 end" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Also, be careful as placing a Z-piece or S-piece into this shape creates a need for an I-piece.<br>
         Conversely, if an I-piece comes first, placing it in one side to make a 2-column wide hole makes processing easier.<br>
         Even then, it's good if you can determine whether you need a Z-piece or S-piece, but it's better if you can consider not just the piece flow (tsumo) but also the needs elsewhere in the stack.<br><br>
         If the 3-column wide hole isn't deep yet, and the height difference between the 3rd and 4th columns is 2 rows, place the J-piece standing up.
