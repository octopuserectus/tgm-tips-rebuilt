  <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">
    As mentioned in <a href="{{ '/tips/14-death-m.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 14</a>, the m-roll is an extremely difficult stage where blocks become invisible the moment they lock. The first time, you might top out without clearing a single line.<br>
    To clear it, a different mindset than before is necessary. Basically, you have to memorize the stack shape, but you don't need to remember everything; just enough to survive for one minute.<br>
    If you can memorize it smoothly, that's best, but normally that's probably impossible, so ingenuity is required to make it as easy to remember and hard to forget as possible.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Hit the Wall / Fit into Gaps</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/16pics/01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Staff roll stacking strategy" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         To clear this, you need to <span class="highlight">focus your thoughts as much as possible on remembering the stack shape</span> and avoid wasting unnecessary attention on other things.<br><br>
         For example, controls. If you use operations that require many inputs like bumps (kon-kon) or placements that stop at the edge of a cliff, your attention goes there, making it easy to forget other parts of the stack.<br>
         To clear the m-roll, you generally stack without using soft drop to gain as much time as possible, but then the worry is "editing the past". If you're worried about timing to avoid editing the past, you won't be able to focus on remembering the stack.<br>
         To avoid such worries, place blocks by fitting them into gaps or hitting them against walls so they can't move further. In other words, thinking about placements that <span class="highlight">prioritize DAS charge</span> becomes important.<br><br>
         Even when not moving horizontally at all, intentionally inputting towards the wall to confirm the terrain exists there has the effect of making it harder to forget.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Prioritize Surface Options</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/16pics/03.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Visualizing staff roll surface" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Using DAS charge frequently generally leads to a concave center and hard-to-recover central holes. However, to maintain memory even slightly during the m-roll, it's better to use DAS charge frequently as mentioned above, and if holes form, don't worry and stack on top. Basically, don't think about recovery.<br>
         Out of habit, you might worry about where and what kind of holes formed, but it's important to firmly discard such thoughts and <span class="highlight">concentrate on grasping the surface shape</span>.<br><br>
         By the way, in my case, I visualize a white line on the screen's well. Some people seem to use the method of playing while picturing a normal-looking well in their head.

  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/16pics/03.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Leaving holes for memorable terrain start" width="119" height="239">
         <span class="arrow">→</span>
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/16pics/04.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Leaving holes for memorable terrain end" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Also, sometimes "it's still possible to place without creating a hole, but to prioritize stack smoothness, intentionally create a hole" becomes important.<br>
         Clearing the m-roll, I believe, is less about extending "the time you can perfectly remember the stack" and more about how much you can perform this "cutoff" (見切り - mikiri) to rebuild a new foundation. It's too late once you're in a "situation where you're forced to create a hole". The key is the <span class="highlight">decisiveness to create a hole yourself "before" that point</span>.<br><br>
         It's almost impossible to remember everything from start to finish. I think it's fine to plan on rebuilding the foundation at least three times like this to clear.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Remember How Many Columns are Open on the Left</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/16pics/04.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Checking left side space 1" width="119" height="239">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/16pics/05.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Checking left side space 2" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Useful when rebuilding the foundation, etc., is to grasp "how many columns are open on the left" at the same time you place a block in the center.<br>
         For example, for blocks other than the O-piece, placing them flat leaves 3 columns open on the left. Placing with "left 1" leaves 2 columns open, and so on.<br>
         It doesn't always apply unless the center is high, but it's worth remembering.
