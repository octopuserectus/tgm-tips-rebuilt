  <p>Also known as "center clearing" (中抜き - nakanuki) or "mid-air clearing" (空中消し - kuuchuu keshi), this refers to placements that seem to create a cavity at first glance, but leave a clean shape by clearing lines.</p>

         This is mostly the same, but note how the single-column width section can be extended.<br><br>
         Ultimately, since skimming is possible with 5 out of the 7 blocks (excluding the Z-piece), keeping the right two columns lower is very advantageous.

         Skimming to produce a flat stack.<br>
         Placing the I-piece flat can surprisingly clear lines in unexpected places. Useful for handling I-pieces that would be obstructive if placed vertically, such as in advanced stages of TAP.

         It's also possible to insert like this and clear two lines.<br>
         If the setup is mirrored, it's possible with the L-piece.<br>
         It's useful to remember that the need for Z-piece vs S-piece also swaps before and after the clear.
