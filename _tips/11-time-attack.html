  <h3 class="section-heading">Achieving the GM Grade</h3>
  <p>
    Once you can max out, aim for the highest grade, GM.<br>
    To achieve GM, the minimum condition is to <span class="highlight">max out with S9 grade (120,000 points or more) within 13 minutes 30 seconds</span>.<br>
    There seem to be several other conditions, like reaching S4 by Lv 500, but if you stack quickly and cleanly, it shouldn't be that difficult.<br><br>
    Speed and cleanliness might seem contradictory, but remember that "getting faster by being cleaner (regional variation: stack cleaner and faster)" is also true.<br>
    If the stack shape is clean, finding placements is easy, and grasping the resulting shape is also easy. Often, the controls are simpler too.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin: 2em 0;">

  <p>
    Once you can get GM, aim for under 10 minutes max out time in time attack.<br>
    I think you can get down to around 11 minutes just by diligently using soft drop, but beyond that, you'll be shaving off time in fractions of a second.<br>
    Since you drop over 700 blocks from start to max out, speeding up each piece by just 0.1 seconds saves over a minute overall.

         In 20G, in a situation like this, how would you stand up the S-piece leaving the rightmost column empty?<br>
         If the drop speed were slow, you could DAS charge right to the edge with the piece upright and then tap back once, but in 20G it would fall.<br>
         Inputting right one tap at a time requires 4 inputs and takes time.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Clearing Lines Together</h3>
  <p>
    When clearing lines, the ARE becomes 0.7 seconds longer than when not clearing. Therefore, naturally, reducing the number of line clears speeds up the time.<br>
    Assuming the time loss for a 4-line clear is 0, each clear results in the following delays: 3-line clear: 0.18s, 2-line clear: 0.35s, <span class="highlight">1-line clear: 0.53s</span>.

         Just because you can recover instantly with an I-piece single doesn't mean you should in time attack.<br>
         You want to develop this into a double, triple, or ideally, a Tetris.
      </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    However, don't overdo it. Especially when aiming for max out times from the low 10-minute range to the high 9-minute range, "<span class="highlight">maintaining a constant soft drop rhythm is more important than forcibly aiming for multi-line clears</span>".<br>
    For example, even in the <a href="{{ '/assets/images/11pics/tgm.mpg' | relative_url }}">TGM video</a> released on the <a href="https://www.arika.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Arika website</a>, while it's primarily based on Tetrises, you can see quite a few other smaller clears mixed in. Nevertheless, by mastering control optimization and maintaining a constant soft drop rhythm, an extremely fast time of 9:19 is achieved.<br>
    Develop setups only within the range you can do without hesitation.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         What to do when an S-piece comes with no suitable placement?<br>
         In 20G, using a shift placement (zurashi-ire) is an option, but early on it's a time loss. (Though, once the drop speed picks up to a certain point, it's not necessary to avoid it so forcefully.)<br><br>
         If you stand it up and insert it into the hole, you perform a single line clear, and then you still need to clear another line to recover.<br>
         Since the block is stood up, the subsequent stack shape also tends to become rugged.

      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Therefore, the recommended method is to place it flat, covering the hole.<br>
         This way, you can recover with a single line clear.<br><br>
         Furthermore, stacking "O-piece → L-piece" on top creates a Tetris recovery setup. Learn this as a set.<br>
         The L-piece placement is useful for "adding just a 1-cell lid on a narrow foothold".

         In the case of the Z-piece, stand it up like this.<br>
         Placing a T-piece on top develops into a triple recovery setup.
      </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Stack High Early On</h3>
  <p>Since soft drop speed is 1G, the time lost due to the length of the drop distance accumulates considerably. Therefore, the standard strategy early on is to stack high to minimize the time blocks spend in the air.<br>
     When aiming for a 9-minute GM, become able to stack up to around 16 rows high while still performing control optimizations without charge delays.</p>
  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/11pics/14.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Stack high on left" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Even stacking high, if you leave the right two columns open, you can always escape with skimming, so topping out due to bad piece draw (tsumo) is almost never an issue.<br>
         Since the game is about how much you can shorten the drop distance, prioritizing stacking the left edge all the way to the top is likely advantageous.<br><br>
         Also, since dropping from the very top of the well to the bottom takes 0.3 seconds, considering the 0.18 second loss for a triple, "<span class="highlight">a triple clear high up is more valuable than a Tetris at the very bottom</span>".<br>
         Therefore, if you stack with setups for both Tetris and triple, you can stack more aggressively, and losses due to hesitation will likely decrease.
      </div>
  </div>

      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         If a hole forms in a low position, it's often better to ignore it and stack on top without trying to recover immediately.<br>
         Early on, it's a game of who drops pieces from the highest position, so recovery can be done after the drop speed increases.<br><br>
         "<span class="highlight">It's not a mistake until you make a compromise clear</span> (妥協消し - dakyou-geshi)".
      </div>
  </div>

  <p>As a point of caution, as the stack gets higher, the time from block appearance to locking naturally shortens, meaning the block appearance pitch inevitably speeds up.<br>
     If you continue playing with the same feeling as right after the start, your reactions will gradually lag, potentially causing DAS charge delays and dropping pieces one column short.</p>

         "Instant Flip" (瞬間裏返し - shunkan uragaeshi) using the C button to rotate twice.<br>

         In this case, holding C for IRS, then inputting A and Down the moment it appears allows for locking at the fastest possible timing.<br><br>
         By the way, the processing order within a frame is "Rotation → Horizontal Movement → Drop", as mentioned in Chapter 7, but <span class="highlight">the judgment for locking via soft drop occurs even after that</span>.<br>
         Therefore, in this case, the button for the second rotation and the down input for soft drop can be simultaneous (within the same frame).

         Rather than thinking "A twice = AC", it's easier to understand as "<span class="highlight">to flip, slam the buttons on both ends</span>".

         Note that you must shift one space sideways before the wall kick is possible.<br>
         It's a detailed point, but because processing is "Rotation → Horizontal Movement → Drop", even if you press the button later, if it's within the same frame, it gets judged first and won't rotate. Again, until you're used to it, it's recommended to perform it slowly and surely.

         An example where using wall kicks turns a bump (kon-kon) into a single horizontal input.<br>
         Since the second rotation and soft drop can be simultaneous, it can lock at roughly the same timing as operations like "DAS charge → down" or "horizontal → down".<br>
         The strength of optimization using wall kicks, besides shortening the operation time itself, I believe lies in "being able to maintain a constant soft drop rhythm". Recovering rhythm after a bump takes time.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Pre-Charging DAS (とり溜め - tori-tame)</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">
         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/11pics/15.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="DAS charging example" width="119" height="239">
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         "Tori-tame" means, instead of thinking about placement then starting the charge, you start charging to one side while thinking about placement.<br>
         That said, in TGM, it's almost always used with left charge.<br><br>
         The ideal for time attack is "charge complete before appearance, and upon reaching the edge after appearance, lock instantly without stopping for even a single frame", and reality is how close you can get to that.<br>
         Actually, the accumulation of slight losses from charge delays is extremely troublesome in time attack.<br>
         Stacking methods can be reflected upon and improved endlessly afterwards, but momentary hesitation during play is not something easily improved through reflection.<br><br>
         This "tori-tame" allows zero charge delay if a placement on the left side is found. Even if an operation other than left charge is needed and you have to redo it, the loss isn't that significant.<br>
         Efficiency should improve if you can identify when to use it based on the stack shape and piece flow (tsumo).<br>
         Using it for 3-4 blocks consecutively is desirable; at this time, the lever movement repeats as "left charge → moment block appears, briefly input down then left charge → ...".<br><br>
         Also, using "tori-tame" helps in quickening the soft drop timing.<br>
         Since TGM blocks are relatively heavy (long DAS charge time), it's often unclear whether there was a charge delay or none at all. This makes it difficult to confidently soft drop at an aggressively early timing.<br>
         However, if "tori-tame" succeeds, you can operate knowing <span class="highlight">with certainty that there was absolutely no charge delay</span>, making it easier to find the optimal timing by repeating trials like "this timing was OK, so next time let's try inputting down a split second earlier".<br><br>
         While it has various benefits, overuse carries the risk of disrupting the stack shape, so be mindful of that.
