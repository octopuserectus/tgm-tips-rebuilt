  <h3 class="section-heading">Overview</h3>
  <p>
    It takes 44 seconds for the <b style="color:#0000ff;">ARIKA</b> logo to <span class="highlight">stop in the middle, and the screen will clear in <b>54.5 seconds</b></span>.<br><br>
    The strategy here is largely the same as in the TAP invisible staff roll, with the exception of the new mechanics in Ti.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Grasping the Rhythm at the Start</h3>
  <p>
    In the invisible roll, most of your thinking must be devoted to "memorizing." Therefore, even players who can aggressively soft drop when blocks are visible might "get beaten by the speed" if they're not used to the task of memorizing, because their thinking can't keep up. Thus, implementing speed countermeasures is crucial. Especially at the start, the terrain is completely cleared, so lock delay resets don't occur at all, the distance to the NEXT queue changes, the BGM changes – there are significant environmental shifts, and I think you'll temporarily be playing without a grasp of the rhythm. If you get preoccupied with memorizing here and neglect rhythm awareness, there's no path forward.<br>
    Before the roll starts, look carefully at the 3 NEXT blocks and decide firmly where to place the first three pieces. It's NG (no good) to worry about whether a block "disappeared" and shift your gaze to the fallen block. Confirming disappearance can be done sufficiently with peripheral vision. (For this, practicing stacking at the start of Shirase while looking down as little as possible might be good training.)
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Right-Side Rotation Placement</h3>
  <p>
    Generally, you often place blocks starting from the left, but I think a major point is to <span class="highlight"><b>prepare columns 8 and 9 as quickly as possible to establish the shape for waiting for an I-piece on the right edge</b></span>. First, the "→ charge ←" (DAS right, tap left) technique carries the risk of getting stuck on the right edge if you haven't memorized the terrain there. Also, all blocks except the I-piece, if moved "→→→" (without rotation), will leave the rightmost column empty, but this is dangerous if you don't know you can drop down a step.<br>
    Therefore, what I recommend is the <span class="highlight"><b>rotation placement for Purple (S), Light Blue (J), Orange (L), and Red (I)</b></span> (a term I just made up, essentially the same operation optimization as in <a href="{{ '/tips/11-time-attack.html' | relative_url }}">Lesson 11</a>). The noteworthy point of this operation is: "If you can get it to the edge (for Orange, rotating 3 times is more effective), terrain where you can't rotate from there is practically non-existent in actual play. <span class="highlight"><b>You can always rotate</b></span>.
    In other words, you can place it without ever blocking the right edge." There's no reason not to use this effectively. There are quite a few cases where "I don't remember the right-side terrain precisely, but I know I can lay it flat and get it to the right," and this increases the time available to think ahead. While seeing the 3 NEXT blocks is fundamental, realistically, in the invisible roll, you often have to watch and see if a block moved as intended (of course, immediately returning your gaze afterward), so being able to omit this check is significant.<br>
    Remembering patterns like "→→" + vertical I-piece, or "→" + rotation placement into a 2-column gap, will also be helpful when rebuilding the foundation, etc.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Do not hold back the I</h3>
  <p>
    In the invisible roll, where "ease of memorization" is a high priority for stacking, the concept of choosing between NEXT and HOLD introduced in <a href="{{ '/tips/17-new-system.html' | relative_url }}">Lesson 17</a> becomes very powerful. I think you should use HOLD frequently. Especially leaving an I-piece (Red) in HOLD constantly is wasteful. In the invisible roll, running out of I-pieces is rare; I think it's more often the case that an oversupply becomes obstructive. Therefore, if there's a place you can put an I-piece, I think it's better to be willing to pull the held I-piece out without hesitation. (Unless the terrain is stacked somewhat high and the Tetris hole is deep.)
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Be suspicious of holes</h3>
  <p>
    When I clear a line, I'm always suspicious of any holes hidden underneath. Especially when I had to compromise earlier. If I cannot remember how I compromised, I'll just place my blocks on the side. If you suspect that a line would disappear and it does not, you can be overwhelmed by upcoming blocks.
