        <div class="text example-explanation">
            If you make a lot of deep holes, you might die trying to fill them up.<br><br>
            2 block deep holes can only be filled with 3 of the 7 tetrominoes, giving you less than 50% chance to fill them up. If there is a block in the way, this can even be reduced to 2. When the hole is 3 blocks deep, you can only wait for the I block.<br><br>
            Keep that in mind while stacking.

         <div class="text example-explanation">
             If the stack is too flat, you'll not easily get rid of S and Z.<br><br>
             But if it is too bumpy, the O block will impose some trouble.

         <div class="text example-explanation">
             Many people build their stack too flat or too bumpy.<br>
             In the case of the S, Z J and L you should <span class="highlight">always try to lay them flat.</span><br>

             <span class="highlight">You should lay them down like this</span> so you leave all possibilities open.

    <h3 class="section-heading">Learning the colors of the blocks</h3>
    <p>
        I think it is wise to learn the colors of all the blocks, since the <span class="highlight">next block</span> is visible at the top of the screen. In high speed situations you should be able to recognise blocks by their color.
    </p>

        <div class="text example-explanation">
           S and Z are very commonly used to fill holes of 2 columns wide.<br><br>
           The T block can be used to alternate between S and Z.

       <div class="text example-explanation">
          J and L can be used for the same purpose.<br>
          But in this case the I is used to alternate between them.

    <h3 class="section-heading">Reading the block flow</h3>
    <p>
        The TGM games have a balanced block flow. It is unlikely to get the same block multiple times in a row, so you can use this to know when to expect a block.
    </p>
     <div class="info-section">
        <div class="example-images">
           <img src="{{ '/assets/images/2pics/12.png' | relative_url }}" alt="T placement decision 1" width="119" height="239">

        <div class="text example-explanation">
           When placing a T like here you should pay attention to the upcoming block.<br>
           If it is an L, place it to the left.<br>
           If it is a J, place it to the right.
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="text example-explanation">
            You should also pay attention to upcoming S and Z blocks.<br>
            Given the upcoming S, we should place the I to the left.<br>
            You should always consider both the S and Z blocks.<br><br>
            In this case we can lean a Z block against the J on the right, or we can fit it in the hole to the left.
