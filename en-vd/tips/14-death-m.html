    <h3 class="section-heading">Death Mode Overview (TAP)</h3>
    <p>
        Death mode starts at speeds similar to the ending of master mode. During the run from Lv.1 to 900 the delays shorten every section.
    </p>
    <p>
        The torikan moment in death mode is at LV.500 if you reach it with more than 03:25:00 on the clock.<br>
        You will need to finish up to Lv.999 for the Gm rank.
    </p>

    <h3 class="section-heading">IRS in Death Mode</h3>

            <img src="{{ '/assets/images/14pics/01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Death IRS example" width="119" height="239">
       </div>
       <div class="text example-explanation">
            Starting from LV.300 the ARE becomes extremely short which means you'll have to time your IRS input well.<br>
            If the current block has not yet locked, you could easily rotate it by accident.<br>
            You should release the rotate button as soon as you have rotated, but keep yourself ready to hit it again as soon as the block locks.<br><br>
            In this example:<br>
            You shift the O to the left and wait for it to lock and then hold A.<br>
            Rotate the L again while shifting to the left and then hold A.<br>
            You shift the S to the right against the obstruction and rotate against it.<br>
            This leaves room to IRS the I into position.

    <h3 class="section-heading">Manual locking, compromises and skimming</h3>
   <div class="info-section">
        <div class="example-images">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/images/14pics/02.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Death strategy example" width="119" height="239">
        </div>
        <div class="text example-explanation">
            To get to Lv.500 before 03:25:00, you should get to Lv.300 in about 2 minutes.<br>
            Manual locking changes in Lv.300 since the ARE is too short to effectively do so.<br>
            Therefore you should play as fast as possible in early death mode.<br><br>
            As seen in <a href="{{ '/en-vd/tips/11-time-attack.html' | relative_url }}">Lesson 11</a> manual locking is a great way to save time.<br>
            In death your goal is not to clear only tetrisses, but to keep 2 columns open to the right so that you have many possibilities.<br>
            You should also aim to form the stack in a rightwards sloping slope.

           While it is in your best interests to keep a hole free terrain, these are cases where doing so would impede movement.<br>
           In these cases we leave some easy to fix holes so that our possibilities of movement are still the same.

    <h3 class="section-heading">IRS after manual locking</h3>
   <div class="info-section">
        <div class="example-images">
            <img src="{{ '/assets/images/14pics/06.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="IRS after manual lock example" width="119" height="239">
        </div>
        <div class="text example-explanation">
            To be able to get a good time and a nice rhythm in your game, you have to be able to use IRS after you manual lock a piece into play.<br>
            However, the ARE will become extremely short nearing the end of death mode.<br>
            Lv.300 will feel slow compared to later levels, where if you hesitate even a little bit, the block will lock.<br><br>
            What matters is to stack blocks on the left and clear lines on the right.<br><br>
            Do keep an eye out for dangerous situations though. And do not try to be foolish and wait as long as possible to clear lines.
