  <p>
    Tetris rotation systems are broadly divided into "Sega-style" and "BPS-style". BPS-style seems to be becoming the world standard recently, called the "World Rule".<br>
    TGM follows the Sega-style rotation system, and as shown in the table above, <span class="highlight">except for the I-piece, pieces rotate such that the height of their lowest edge does not change</span>. You could also say they roll along the ground.<br>
    It might seem a bit unnatural at first, but I think this rotation system makes rotation placement (回転入れ - kaiten-ire) easy to use and features easy operation in high-speed drop areas.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">About the "Well"</h3>
  <div class="info-section">
    <img src="{{ '/assets/images/1pics/kiso01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="TGM Playfield Diagram" width="119" height="239">
    <div class="text example-explanation"> 
      The "Well" (or Playfield) is composed of <span class="highlight">20 rows (lines) × 10 columns</span>. Usually counted as 1st row, 2nd row... from the bottom, and 1st column, 2nd column... from the left.<br>
      However, as shown in the diagram, pieces can overhang one row above when rotated. To rotate the I-piece, the top 3 rows of the well must be empty, but other blocks can be rotated if the top 2 rows are empty.<br>
      The collection of stacked blocks is called the "<span class="highlight">Stack</span>" (地形 - chikei).<br>
      If a block overlaps the stack when it appears, the game is over; this is called "topping out" (窒息 - chissoku).<br>
      The block appearing next, displayed above the well, is called the "NEXT display" or simply "NEXT".
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="section-heading">About "Level" and "Max Out"</h3>
  <p>
    Game progress is represented by "Level (Lv)".<br>
    It starts at Lv 0, and clearing the game at Lv 999 is called "maxing out" (カンスト - kansuto), short for counter stop.<br>
    The level <span class="highlight">increases by 1 each time a block appears</span> (tsumo - ツモ), and <span class="highlight">increases by the number of lines cleared</span> when lines are cleared.<br>
    (Meaning, to max out, you drop just over 700 blocks and clear just under 300 lines).<br><br>
    Each 100-level interval is called a "<span class="highlight">section</span>".<br>
    The boundary between sections (Lv *99 → Lv *00, only Lv 998 → Lv 999 at the end) can only be passed by clearing lines.<br>
    Just drawing a piece keeps the level at Lv *99; this is called "<span class="highlight">level stop</span>". This results in lost time during time attacks.<br><br>
    Example: Clearing 1 line with a block at Lv 99 makes it Lv 100, and the next piece draw is Lv 101.<br>
    Clearing 4 lines with a block at Lv 98 makes it Lv 102, and the next piece draw is Lv 103.<br>
    Clearing 4 lines with a block at Lv 95 makes it Lv 99, and the next piece draw is <B>still</B> Lv 99.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">About "20G"</h3>
  <p>
    The game draws 60 images per second to express movement, and each of these frames is called a "<span class="highlight">frame</span>".<br>
    Block drop speed is expressed in units of "<span class="highlight">G</span>", representing "how many rows dropped per frame".<br>
    One of the most characteristic features symbolizing the TGM series is <B>20G</B>, where blocks don't so much fall as suddenly "appear on the ground" (or rather, on the stack).
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">About "Lock Delay" and "ARE"</h3>
  <p>
    There is a slight delay between when a block touches the stack and when it locks (the block flashes white momentarily), during which it can be rotated or moved horizontally.<br>
    Especially in 20G where blocks appear grounded instantly, this period is used to slide blocks for movement.<br>
    This time is called "Lock Delay" (固定時間 - kotei jikan), and in TGM it is set to about 0.5 seconds. It shortens in the advanced stages of TAP.<br>
    Lock delay resets when the piece drops down a step. (See <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/05-fast-falling.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 5</a>)<br><br>
    There is also a slight delay after a block locks and before the next block appears; this is called "ARE".<br>
    It shortens in the advanced stages of TAP.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">About "Soft Drop" and "DAS"</h3>
  <p>
    Holding the lever down during block fall allows you to make the block fall faster. This speed is 1G; if the natural gravity is faster than that, it doesn't change.<br>
    Pressing the lever down while a block is grounded forces the block to lock immediately, even if lock delay time remains.<br>
    In the TGM series, "Soft Drop" (下入れ - shita-ire) generally refers to the latter. The former is also called "Drop".<br><br>
    Holding the lever sideways for a while allows for high-speed horizontal movement of the block; this is called "<span class="highlight">DAS</span>" (Delayed Auto-Shift) (横溜め - yoko-tame).<br>
    (The movement speed is equivalent to 1G, so it's the same as inputting sideways every frame).<br>
    The time until it "charges" is called "<span class="highlight">DAS Charge Time</span>" (横溜め時間 - yoko-tame jikan), which is about 0.25 seconds in TGM. It shortens in the advanced stages of TAP.<br>
    <span class="highlight">DAS input is accepted even before the block appears</span>. If it's already "charged" before appearance, the block will fly sideways the moment it appears.<br>
    This is important for time attacks.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">About "IRS"</h3>
  <p>
    IRS stands for Initial Rotation System (先行回転入力システム - senkou kaiten nyuuryoku system).<br>
    <span class="highlight">If a button is held down when the block appears</span>, the block will appear in the well already rotated once.<br>
    It enables comfortable controls even at high drop speeds, so you should consciously use it early on to make it natural.

  <h3 class="section-heading">About "Wall kicks"</h3>
   <div class="info-section">
     <div class="example-images">
       <img src="{{ '/assets/images/1pics/01.png' | relative_url }}" alt="T piece next to wall" width="119" height="239">
       <div class="icon-group">

         <img src="{{ '/assets/images/1pics/01.gif' | relative_url }}" alt="Rotation icon" width="31" height="31">
       </div>
       <img src="{{ '/assets/images/1pics/02.png' | relative_url }}" alt="T piece rotated, kicking off wall" width="119" height="239">
     </div>
     <div class="text example-explanation">
       Consider rotating a block near the wall as shown.<br>
       Thinking according to the rotation rules presented above, it seems impossible to rotate because the left square would clip into the wall.<br>
       However, because there is space to shift to the right, the position is automatically corrected, allowing the rotation.<br>
       This allows easy rotation of blocks moved to the edge with DAS, and along with IRS, it supports the comfortable controls of the TGM series.<br>
       It's useful in many situations, such as the rotation placements (回転入れ - kaiten-ire) introduced in <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/08-advanced-rotation.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 8</a> and the control optimization introduced in <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/11-time-attack.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 11</a>.
