  <h3 class="section-heading">I-piece and T-piece Correction</h3>
  <p>
    For details, refer to <s><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061221161359/http://web.iis.to/tetris_tgm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KAN's講座</a> (KAN's lectures)</s> <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Arika_Rotation_System#Kicks_added_in_Tetris_The_Grand_Master_3_Terror-InstinctTetrisWiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TetrisWiki</a>.<br>
    Due to the increased flexibility of the I-piece's movement, it's easier to maintain fast stacking without worrying too much about "creating terrain that allows the I-piece to reach the edge".<br>
    However, precisely because of this, it's possible to unintentionally reach speeds you can't control, so be careful. When the stack shape is reasonably clean, you can keep stacking, but if it collapses, there's a risk of being overwhelmed all at once.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">HOLD</h3>
  <p>
    Regarding HOLD, I think <a href="https://slappin-beats.hatenablog.jp/entry/20051218/p2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">613's concept of "Choice between NEXT and HOLD"</a> (Japanese) is extremely helpful.<br>
    To become proficient with HOLD, don't use it only when "necessary situations" arise, but use it constantly whenever possible. As speed increases, even if you know in your head that this is a situation to use HOLD, hesitation might prevent your hands from moving. Become able to press the button confidently by getting the "reps" in.
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Three NEXT Pieces</h3>
  <p>
    I believe the most crucial aspect of clearing Ti is "looking at all three NEXT pieces". Being able to see further ahead blocks and change your stacking method is important, of course, but the fact that <span class="highlight"><strong>the time between a block appearing on screen and appearing in the well is long</strong></span> holds great significance in the world of ultra-high speeds.<br>
    Don't overcomplicate it from the start; just "looking" is enough initially. Just "glancing at what kind of blocks are coming in the future" is fine. The thinking ability to respond to that will come with practice.<br><br>
    What's important is that this "ability to see 3 NEXT pieces" isn't something you master once and then no longer need to be conscious of; you must constantly pay attention. As you aim for faster speeds and higher grades, the desire to "stack as cleanly as possible" grows stronger, and because of that, attention tends to focus on the stack shape, with your gaze downwards. Before you know it, you're only looking at one NEXT piece. Even looking at only one, you can stack reasonably well in the short term, aided by the I-piece movement and HOLD mentioned above. Therefore, it's hard to notice during frantic play, but it lacks stability and can become a cause for hitting a plateau.
