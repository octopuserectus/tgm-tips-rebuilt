  <h3 class="section-heading">Overview</h3>
  <p>
    At 44 seconds, the <strong class="arika-logo">ARIKA</strong> logo appears; at 48.5 seconds it stops in the center; clear at <span class="highlight"><strong>54.5 seconds</strong></span>.<br><br>
    The basic strategy is an I-piece setup on the right edge (for Tetrises). As touched upon in the previous chapter, frequently performing small clears means the stack shape (surface) changes rapidly, making memorization difficult. From the perspective of the I-piece's mobility as well, I think stacking aiming for Tetrises is actually safer.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Grasping the Rhythm at the Start</h3>
  <p>
    In the disappearing roll (消えロール - kie-roru), most of your thinking must be dedicated to "memorizing". Therefore, even players who can normally soft drop aggressively might find their thinking can't keep up if they're not used to the task of memorizing, leading to being "beaten by the speed". Thus,しっかり (shikkari - firmly/properly) addressing speed countermeasures is necessary. Especially at the start, the stack is completely cleared, creating a blank slate, so lock delay resets don't happen at all, the distance to NEXT changes, the BGM changes – due to considerable environmental shifts, you'll likely be playing temporarily without having grasped the rhythm. If you get preoccupied with memorizing here and neglect rhythm awareness, there's no path forward.<br>
    Before the roll starts, look carefully at the 3 NEXT pieces and firmly decide the placement for the first three blocks. It's NG to look down at the falling block wondering if it "disappeared". Confirming whether it disappeared is sufficiently done in the corner of your vision. (Practicing stacking in the Shirase opening while looking down as little as possible might be good for this.)
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Right-Side Rotation Placement</h3>
  <p>
    Basically, you often place blocks starting from the left side, but I think a major point is to <span class="highlight"><strong>prepare the 8th and 9th columns as quickly as possible to establish the right-edge I-piece setup</strong></span>. First, "DAS charge right then tap left" carries the risk of getting stuck on the right edge if you haven't memorized the right-side stack shape. Also, all blocks except the I-piece end up leaving the rightmost column empty with "→→→" (without rotation), but this is dangerous unless you know you can drop down a step.<br>
    Therefore, what's recommended is <span class="highlight"><strong>rotation placement for S, T, L, and I pieces</strong></span> (用語 - yougo - term; just made this up now, basically the same as the control optimization in <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/11-time-attack.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 11</a>). The noteworthy point about this operation is, "if you can bring it to the edge (for L-piece, the 3-rotation is more effective), there's almost no stack shape in actual play that prevents rotation from there. <span class="highlight"><strong>It always rotates</strong></span>. In other words, you can place it without ever blocking the right edge". There's no reason not to use this effectively. Cases where "I don't accurately remember the right-side stack shape, but I know I can bring it right flat" are quite common, and this increases the time available to think ahead. While seeing 3 NEXT pieces is the fundamental premise, realistically, in the disappearing roll, you often have to watch to see if the block moved as intended (of course, immediately returning your gaze afterwards), so being able to omit that confirmation is significant.<br>
    Remembering patterns like "→→ + I-piece stand" and "→ + 2-wide rotation placement" also demonstrates power when rebuilding the foundation, etc.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Don't Hesitate to Use the I-piece</h3>
  <p>
    When stacking, where "ease of memorization" is a high priority, the idea of "Choice between NEXT and HOLD" introduced in <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/17-new-system.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 17</a> becomes very powerful. I think HOLD should be used rapidly (どんどん, don-don). Especially keeping an I-piece perpetually in HOLD is wasteful. In the disappearing roll, running out of I-pieces is rare; rather, I think it's more common for an oversupply to become obstructive. So, if there's a place to put an I-piece, I think it's better to be willing to pull the held I-piece out without hesitation. (Unless the stack is built up quite high and the Tetris hole is deep.)
  </p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Be Alert That Lines Might Not Clear</h3>
  <p>
    When placing a block thinking a line will clear, if it doesn't clear due to an unexpected hole, it can cause panic. Especially when stabilizing after a compromise placement → stacking cleanly on top → inserting an I-piece into the right edge, be careful not to forget about the compromise placement and think, "Why didn't it clear when I was stacking cleanly?". If something clears when you didn't expect it to, you can usually cope by just delaying the next operation slightly. But if you expect a clear and it doesn't happen, the next block falls sooner than anticipated, becoming a cause for *gogogo*-ing.
