  <p>Let's look in detail at raising the center, as mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>

         The Z-piece and O-piece can be moved to either side when the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> column is high.<br>
         These could be called blocks that are easy to move to the right.

         The S-piece can be moved to either side when the 4<sup>th</sup> or 5<sup>th</sup> column is high.<br>
         This could be called a block that is easy to move to the left.

  <div class="info-section">
      <div class="example-images">

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         The J-piece and L-piece can be moved to either side if any of the 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, or 6<sup>th</sup> columns are high.<br>
         IRS might be needed in these cases, but fundamentally these two are blocks with wide movement ranges.

      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         In the case of the I-piece, if any column from the 4<sup>th</sup> to the 7<sup>th</sup> is high, it can be moved to either side, but the issue is often whether it can be stood up vertically afterwards.

  <p>
    In other words, <span class="highlight">if the 5th column is high, all blocks can be moved to either side</span>. This is the first step to conquering 20G.<br>
    However, during play, you can't be counting columns from the left like 1st, 2nd...<br>
    Therefore, since the block appearance position is fixed, you just need to remember "what operation to perform on the appearing block to make the 5th column high".

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         <b>"L/J Stand Up In Place" (Ｌのその場立て - L no sonoba-date):</b><br>
         As speed increases, one tends to want to move blocks sideways, but the key is whether you can think of and execute this placement during play.<br>
         Beginners at 20G, of course, but even when doing time attacks or when the block appearance pitch increases in advanced TAP stages, fear often leads to flattening the stack, which then tends to collapse. At such times, try remembering this placement. Your ability to maintain the stack shape should differ.

         <b>"Z/S Down the Stairs" (Ｚの階段落とし - Z no kaidan-otoshi):</b><br>
         The rotation rules for Z and S pieces might be hard to remember at first.<br>
         Just remember it as "dropping down one step of the stairs".
      </div>

         Even when the J or L pieces are flipped, similarly "shift one step outwards".

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         <b>"5th Column I Stand" (５列目赤立て - 5 retsume aka-date):</b><br>
         If you stand the I-piece up in place, the 6th column becomes high, so the operation "left 1" is necessary.<br>
         The right diagram is an advanced version involving horizontal movement before rotation.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         For the T-piece and O-piece, just dropping them in place makes the 5th column high.<br>
         In the case of the O-piece, remembering the "left 1" operation is convenient for various situations.
