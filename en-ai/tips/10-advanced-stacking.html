  <p>
    In 20G where movement range is limited, maintaining a good stack shape consistently requires not just "fitting pieces into given gaps" but also "actively creating easily stackable shapes".<br>
    (The placement method of keeping the 5th column high, introduced in <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/06-fifth-column.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 6</a>, is the prime example of this.)

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         If you stand the T-piece up in columns 8-9, the overall shape becomes "moderately stepped and smooth".<br>
         If the drop speed is slow, there's no particular problem, but in 20G, you won't be able to get the I-piece to the right edge.<br>
         Therefore, by stopping at columns 7-8 and keeping the right two columns low, you can maintain a stack shape that allows the I-piece to reach the right edge.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         In this case too, by leaving the right two columns open, you can bring the I-piece to the right edge.<br>
         The horizontal hole can be followed up by shifting a J-piece in or using a T-piece rotation placement.

         In 20G where "if there's a step, it instantly drops to the bottom", such "shift placements" (ずらし入れ - zurashi-ire) are very easy to use, and with practice, you can slide blocks in with extremely fast operations.<br>

         Including those requiring multiple blocks for follow-up, there are countless stacking methods like this.<br><br>
         Key points for the right side of the well are:<br>
         ・Create horizontal holes opening to the right<br>
         ・Keep the right 2-3 columns open<br>
         If a horizontal hole opens right, it can usually be followed up using shift placements or rotation placements, and if a 2-column width is open, any block can pass through. The concept of "stopping partway" is effective in practice.<br><br>
         It's desirable to know beforehand which block can follow up, but initially, it's not strictly necessary. Rely on feeling, create horizontal holes, try various placements, and find patterns you're good at.

         Thanks to the Synchro introduced in <a href="{{ '/en-ai/tips/07-movement-range.html' | relative_url }}">Chapter 7</a>, gaps in the 2nd column can be jumped over.<br><br>
         Also, leaving the left 3 columns open means making the 4th column high, which means stacking one column left of the 5th column.<br>
         Therefore, the "left 1" operation becomes effective.

         Vertical L-piece insertion (Ｌの縦刺し - L no tate-zashi).<br>
         Stack shape with 1-cell bumps is commonly called a "castle" (城 - shiro), and inserting a J or L piece there creates a T-piece rotation setup (left diagram).<br>
         Being aware that "a 2x1 gap takes a flat Z or S piece" makes this easier to come up with (right diagram). The pattern of placing a J-piece facing left and waiting for a Z-piece shift placement is very effective.

         A 3x2 gap is a chance for a "Denguri-gaeshi" (somersault).<br>
         On the left edge, learn the operation "S-piece left 2" as a set.<br>
         Depending on the piece flow (tsumo), it's better if you can switch between stopping at left 1 and waiting for L (or O -> J).

  <h3 class="section-heading">Compromise Placement (妥協置き - dakyou-oki)</h3>
  <p>In 20G where the 5th column is stacked high, holes near the 5th column are inevitably harder to dig out.<br>
     Therefore, even when forced to create a hole, the mindset of keeping it as far from the 5th column as possible becomes important.</p>

         Inserting the J-piece vertically clears 2 lines, but getting fixated on immediate line clears creates a hole in the 5th column.<br>
         If the stack is low, there's the option of discarding that line, but when trying to recover, a hole in the 5th column is fatal. Whatever it takes, fill the 5th column.<br><br>
         If an I-piece comes first, if you can't place it on the right, create a hole and bring it left even if it means doing so. Defending the 5th column is worth that much.
