  <h3 class="section-heading">Master Mode Overview</h3>
  <p>
    ・From Lv 0 to Lv 499, the speed increases much like in TGM.<br>
    ・At Lv 500, 20G begins, similar to TGM. However, ARE, line clear time, and DAS charge time become slightly shorter.<br>
    ・In the Lv 600 range, the line clear time becomes noticeably shorter.<br>
    ・In the Lv 700 range, ARE and line clear time shorten, making the pace considerably faster.<br>
    ・In the Lv 800 range, ARE and line clear time shorten further. Blocks fall at the same pitch whether you clear lines or not.<br>
    ・In the Lv 900 range, lock delay shortens. Repeating soft drops (下入れの使い回し - shita-ire no tsukaimawashi) becomes impossible.<br><br>
    ・"Instant Drop" (即落下 - soku rakka) by inputting Up on the lever is introduced. It reaches the bottom instantly but only lands without locking, so use it in conjunction with soft drop (down input).<br>
    ・For medal conditions, refer to <s><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061202150350/http://www.geocities.co.jp/HeartLand-Oak/8244/neta.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KJU's Laboratory</a></s> <a href="https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_The_Absolute_The_Grand_Master_2#Medal_conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TetrisWiki</a>.

  <h3 class="section-heading">"Gogogo" in High Speed Ranges</h3>
  <p>
    Mainly in the fast pace from Lv 800 onwards, sometimes when you try to lock a block with soft drop, that block has already locked, and you end up locking the *next* block that just fell, and then another block falls, surprising you. This is generally called "gogogo-ing" (ゴゴゴる - gogogoru, the sound of impending doom).<br>
    Also, in the Lv 900 range where lock delay is short, gogogo can happen even without inputting down. This occurs when "locking → next block appearance" happens "faster than expected". When the appearance timing is known, even if fast, you can somewhat react. Even if hesitation delays your operation, you feel "delayed because I hesitated and thought". However, if a block appears at an unexpected timing, it takes time for the body to react, but people usually aren't conscious of that time. In other words, even though time has actually passed, because there's no sensation of it, it creates the illusion that "it locked instantly".

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Up to the Lv 800 range, the lock delay is the same, so as long as your reactions keep up, "what you can do" doesn't change. However, in the Lv 900 range, the lock delay is roughly halved, restricting possibilities. Therefore, simple operations that don't require many inputs are demanded.<br><br>
         Situations like those shown, where you must charge DAS without being able to trigger a lock delay reset, should be avoided if possible, as should horizontal bumps (コンコン - kon-kon) requiring two taps (unless dropping down a step).<br><br>
         In other words, the key point is to prioritize placements using only DAS charge, single horizontal taps, or placing in place.<br>
         This section is short, so clearing it with momentum alone is possible, but aiming higher requires learning to "stack properly" as early as possible.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Staff Roll and Grade</h3>
  <p>
    In TGM, the staff roll after maxing out was positioned like a victory lap, but in TAP, it's genuinely part of the challenge stages.<br>
    Upon maxing out, all blocks on the well disappear once, and while the staff roll scrolls, blocks start falling again at the same speed as the Lv 900 range.<br>
    Normally, these blocks become invisible about 5 seconds after locking (though they still exist there).<br>
    Surviving this for about one minute until the end earns an orange underline on the ranking screen, called a "Complete Clear" (完全クリア - kanzen clear).<br>
    Topping out during the staff roll results in a green underline, called a "Max Out Clear" (カンストクリア - kansuto clear).<br><br>
    Furthermore, if you max out with "fast" and "skillful" play, a high-difficulty stage occurs during the staff roll where blocks become invisible the instant they lock.<br>
    This is what's called the "m-roll" (ｍロール) or "disappearing roll" (消えるロール - kieru roll). As far as currently confirmed, topping out during this staff roll always results in an <span class="highlight">m grade</span>, and surviving until the end always results in a <span class="highlight">Gm grade</span>.<br>
    m Grade has a green line, Gm Grade has green and orange lines confirmed<s>, but <a href="http://homepage3.nifty.com/tgm/tap020416.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there might still be other grades</a></s>.

  <h3 class="section-heading">Zangi-moves (ザンギ入れ)</h3>
  <p>
    Thanks to the Up input "landing only, no lock", shift placements and rotation placements can be used freely even early on when drop speed is slow.<br>
    Also, by including placements that create setups for these, it becomes possible to avoid time-consuming bumps (kon-kon).<br>
    Zangi-moves take advantage of these features of Up input to achieve time reduction and comfortable controls.<br>
    It originates from the operation of whirling the lever around, like the special move command of a certain famous fighting game character.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         The operation for a Z-piece shift placement to the right in early TAP is:<br><br>
         "DAS charge right, (upon reaching edge) Up for instant drop, Left to shift, Down to lock"<br><br>
         Essentially, just whirl the lever 270° clockwise from right down to left.<br>
         This is the most basic Zangi-move pattern.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         It can be used outside of situations requiring shift placement.<br>
         Since you stack leaving the rightmost column open for an I-piece setup, opportunities to use this should inevitably become very frequent.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Placing one column away is also effective on the left side.<br><br>
         Also, in this case, the down input serves not only for locking but also for dropping. However, for drops of up to 2 or 3 rows, there's no need to consciously hold down longer; the usual feel is fine. (As you'll find if you try, no matter how briefly you think you input down, it inevitably drops about 3 rows anyway. That's why using shift placements in early TGM leads to significant time loss.)

         This is a technique for placing near the center by rotating the lever 180°.<br>
         Since Up input can be done precedingly, if you input Up during the ARE of the previous block and whirl the lever the moment the next appears, movement like 20G is possible.

      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Zangi-moves also have the effect of reducing control errors.<br>
         For example, in this case, performing "Right, Up, Down" normally might cause an unintentional Right input when moving from Up to Down, shifting it further than intended. This is called "horizontal slipping" (横ずれ - yoko-zure).<br>
         It's fine if it gets stuck in the gap upon instant drop, but be careful when there's space to shift further right.<br><br>
         However, for some people, Zangi-moves might conversely have a higher risk of missing the horizontal input and be harder to use.<br>
         It also depends considerably on the lever. In my case, with a Seimitsu lever (see below), I often don't use Zangi-moves much.

  <h3 class="section-heading">About Levers</h3>

      {% comment %} Added a container for the image and its subtitle {% endcomment %}
      <div class="lever-guide-container"> 
         <img class="lever-guide-img" src="{{ '/assets/images/13pics/guide.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Joystick subguides" width="320" height="240">
         <p class="image-subtitle">Left: Seimitsu (セイミツ), Right: Sanwa (サンワ)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text example-explanation">
         Levers are broadly divided into those made by <a href="https://seimitsu.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seimitsu</a> and those made by <a href="https://www.sanwa-d.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sanwa</a>.<br>
         The photo on the left shows the plate called a subguide attached to the underside of each lever; the lever shaft moves within the hole in this plate. Since Tetris only uses the four directions Up, Down, Left, Right, diagonal input is disabled (in the case of the Seimitsu subguide, the upper hole is used).<br><br>
         When whirling the lever around, <span class="highlight">Sanwa-made ones move smoothly in a ◇ shape</span>, while <span class="highlight">Seimitsu-made ones have protrusions inside and catch with a click-click feel</span>.<br><br>
         Experience suggests Sanwa-made ones are easier to whirl, making Zangi-moves easier. Even with Seimitsu-made ones, they become easier to whirl once the protrusions wear down from use. If it catches too much, the "missed horizontal input" mentioned above occurs.<br>
         However, with Sanwa-made ones, perhaps because the lever shaft is often long with a large range of motion, sometimes after inputting sideways and releasing your hand to return to neutral, the spring force causes it to input the opposite direction. Specifically, intending to input "Right, Right" quickly might result in "Right, Left, Right, Left" being input, causing the block to just twitch in place and lock. This is called "rebound" (反動 - handou). Also, the "horizontal slipping" mentioned above seems more likely with Sanwa-made ones. Though some of this can be resolved depending on lever handling.
      </div>
  </div>
  <p>
    When whirling the lever, <span class="highlight">those that move in a □ or ○ shape are set for 8 directions</span> (allowing diagonal input). Fighting games and shooters are mostly set to 8 directions.<br>
    What happens when playing with an 8-direction lever is that diagonal inputs prioritize the horizontal direction. Consequently, intending to input straight down might register as diagonal due to slight deviation, being judged as horizontal input and causing unintended horizontal movement.<br>
    <span class="highlight">The TAP circuit board manual clearly states "Always set the lever to 4 directions"</span>, so ask the arcade staff to change it.
